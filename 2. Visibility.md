# Problem
Give a polygon and a point inside the polygon, you have to say if a person standing at that point can see the whole interior of that polygon. [ Note: A person can see a point if there is nothing in between the person and the point. ]<br>


<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
The sides of the polygon can create a triangle with the given point having negetive or positive area. Is there a relation with the visibility?

<summary>Solution</summary>

Let's say the points of the polygon are given in anti-clockwise order. Now, each two adjascent points of the polygon creates a triangle with the given point inside of that polygon. Now, the area of the polygon can be both positive and negative. But it depends on the in which orientation the points are given. But as the points are given in anti-clockwise order, we have to check if all the points create same signed area (positive/ negetive). If they produce same signed area the whole interior of that polygon is visible from that given point. <br>
Why is that? <br>
Let's try to show the oppsite case where the interior is not visible.
Let's say three points on the polygon are $A, B, C$ and D is the point inside of the polygon.
